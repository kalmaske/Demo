	<h1>Amazon Parrots!</h1>


	<p>Amazon Parrots are striking birds with many color varieties, and are popular options as pets. But it takes an experienced bird owner to handle the personality and upkeep a parrot needs. They're social creatures in need of a lot of interaction and attention. So before you choose an Amazon Parrot as a pet, be sure you know everything you'll need to do to properly care for one.</p><br>


	<h2>Blue Fonted Amazon Parrots</h2>

	<p>Active and comical, Blue Fronted Amazons are natural performers. They love to be around their owners and will "ham it up" for extra attention. Prolific talkers and singers, they vocalize often and can be very loud, so aren't suited to live in close quarters like apartment buildings (unless you have very understanding neighbors).</p><br><br>

	<h2>Red Lored Amazon Parrots</h2>

	<p>Red Lored Amazons are charismatic birds who bond quickly to human family members. Some have a tendency to pick their favorite people and be one-person birds. Red Lored Amazons are talented talkers and singers, but potential owners should be aware that all Amazons can scream and most often, they do.</p><br><br>


	<h2>Orange-Winged Amazon Parrots</h2>

	<p>Orange-Winged Amazons make sweet and affectionate pets and bond closely to their owners. They have excellent speech abilities and charming personalities. But like many Amazon Parrots, Orange-Winged Amazons go through a hormonal "bluffing" stage as they reach sexual maturity. They can become aggressive during this phase, so consider carefully whether this bird (or another Amazon Parrot) is suitable for you.</p><br><br>
